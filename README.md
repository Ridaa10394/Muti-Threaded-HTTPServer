**Multi-threaded HTTP Server (Python)**
📖 Overview

This project implements a fully functional multi-threaded HTTP server built from scratch using Python sockets and thread pooling.
It is designed to serve static files, handle JSON uploads, support HTTP/1.1 keep-alive connections, and demonstrate core networking, concurrency, and protocol design principles.

**Features**

✅ GET / HEAD Support

Serves static files (.html, .txt, .png, .jpg, .jpeg) from the resources/ directory

Protects against directory traversal attacks

Sends appropriate Content-Type, Content-Length, and Connection headers

**POST /upload**

Accepts JSON data via POST requests (Content-Type: application/json)

Saves each upload into resources/uploads/ as a .json file

Returns a success message with a file path

**Thread Pool**

Uses a fixed-size pool of worker threads for concurrent client handling

Supports connection queuing (up to 200 pending connections)

Returns 503 Service Unavailable if the queue is full

**Connection Handling**

Supports persistent connections (keep-alive) with timeout and request limits

Validates Host headers to prevent spoofing

Enforces connection timeouts and maximum header size

**Robust Error Handling**

Handles 400, 403, 404, 405, 415, and 503 response codes gracefully

Logs all activity with timestamps and thread names

**How to Run**
1️⃣ Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ installed

Basic knowledge of terminal commands

2️⃣ Start the Server
python3 server.py

**Supported Endpoints**
GET / or /index.html

Serves the main HTML file.
Example:

curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/

GET /file.txt

Serves a text or binary file from resources/.

HEAD /file.jpeg

Returns only headers (no body).

If opened in chrome then it downloads the image or text file.

POST /upload

Uploads JSON data and saves it as a .json file.

Example:

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Ridaa", "project": "HTTP Server"}'

Response:
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "File created successfully",
  "filepath": "/uploads/upload_20251005_145623_ab3d.json"
}

**Key Concepts Demonstrated**	                                    
Socket Programming - Low-level handling of TCP connections and data transfer
Thread Pool - Efficient concurrency using a fixed number of worker threads
Keep-Alive - Persistent HTTP connections with configurable timeouts
Header Parsing - Manual decoding of HTTP headers and request lines
Security - Path traversal prevention, host validation, size limits
HTTP Protocol - Implementation of request parsing and response formatting

**HTTP Response Codes Used**  
200 OK - Successful GET/HEAD
201 Created - Successful JSON upload
400 Bad Request - Invalid or malformed request
403 Forbidden - Unauthorized path or invalid host
404 Not Found - File does not exist
405 Method Not Allowed - Unsupported HTTP method
415 Unsupported Media Type - File type or content type not allowed
503 Service Unavailable - Thread pool/queue full

**Example Log Output**
[2025-10-05 14:45:10] [Worker-3] Connection from ('127.0.0.1', 52644)
[2025-10-05 14:45:10] [Worker-3] Served HTML: /index.html (324 bytes)
[2025-10-05 14:45:15] [Worker-5] Created JSON upload: upload_20251005_144515_k8df.json (118 bytes)
[2025-10-05 14:45:20] [Worker-2] Connection closed ('127.0.0.1', 52644)

**Testing Suggestions**
Open your browser → Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/
Upload JSON using curl or Postman
Try unsupported paths → expect 403 or 415
Test multiple concurrent requests → observe thread logs
